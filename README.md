## Project Description
Can we predict the level of stress of a person based on the informations on his lifestyle, his achievement, the way he perceives his professional & personal life?
This project is based on responses to an online survey ("Work-Life Balance") which aims to answer the question "How much do you thrive in your professional & personal life?".
Mainly on a personal development side, it could give us some overview of patterns in lifestyle and daily stress. 
By going through supervised and unsupervised learning methods, we try to find some ideas and answers through this big amount of informations we have here...


## Workflow
1. Data Exploration
2. Data Cleaning
3. Preprocessing the data
4. Clustering on the whole dataset
3. Clustering on Least Important Features
4. Build predictive model in order to predict the daily stress index of a person based on several features
5. Compute metrics in order to compare our results & classifiers
